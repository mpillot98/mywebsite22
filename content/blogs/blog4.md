Hello world!

Welcome to my website.

My name is Manon Pillot. I'm a master's student at the London Business School; before that I did my undergrad at the Ecole Hotelière de Lausanne with a Bachelor's in Hospitality Management. There I specialized in portfolio management, hospitality M&A and VBA.

I believe that we can create a deeper connection when speaking someone's mother tongue. That's why I try to learn and practice new languages such as:

-   French is my mother tongue; I speak it mostly with my family.

-   I speak English with my friends.

-   I've studied Italian for 10 years now.

-   And finally, Spanish which I started during my college years.

Here are a few of my hobbies:

-   Skiing has been a part of my life since I was 2 years old; I enjoy skiing every winter.

-   I've been playing golf for the past 10 years; I think it's a great way to learn patience and discipline.

-   During the summer, I practice downhill road biking.

-   My latest hobby is rope climbing and bouldering that I do as training for via ferrata.

I hope to hear from you soon.

Bye!
