Dear whom this may concern,

I am currently interning at the investment bank Carlsquare as an analyst. As my internship ends in June, I would like to join your Graduate Talent Program. UBS being a global bank, your expertise and credibility are illustrated by the importance of the assets you manage.

As a highly motivated, adaptive and detail orientated individual, I have always been inclined towards working with numbers. My academic career at EHL Hospitality Business School covered various topics ranging from Accounting, Financial Analysis, Statistics, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and other corporate-related topics. I am also confident in operating multiple computer programs such as MS Office, Internet search tools and several Property Management Systems.

Through my Portfolio Management and Hospitality Mergers & Acquisitions specialisations, I have learnt to evaluate risks, read financial statements, and learnt the cause and effects of executive decisions in real-time. My internship at Carlsquare enabled me to leverage this knowledge to tackle real-life situations. Furthermore, my role as the Head of Finance within my university’s football committee has allowed me to put my academic education into practice. Moreover, I have used “Plus 500” and “Cornèrtrader” as training software to practice trading, which is a field that fascinates me.

My Bachelor’s thesis addressed the link between eSport and physical sport, using FIFA, F1 2019, and NBA 2K as my case studies. The purpose was to determine whether the relationship was substitutional or complementary.

Apart from my interests within the financial industry, I also have a strong passion for different languages and cultures. I am currently bilingual in French and English and am proficient in Italian and Spanish. I believe that communication is key to a company's success. I have taught myself coding in my free time since I started learning it during my senior year.

With diverse experience both on professional and academic aspects, I want to continue developing my skills within UBS and become a beneficial asset to your team.

I look forward to any opportunity to discuss the position and what I can do for your company. Thank you for your time in reviewing my resume. I am available if you need any additional information.

Sincerely,

Manon Pillot
